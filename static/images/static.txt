Harvesting and yield of Coconuts

<p>Nuts that are 12 months old are harvested at an interval of 30-45 days for culinary purpose and for making copra. Sometimes, depending on the use, tender nuts that are 7 to 8 months old are also harvested. It is considered that 11 months old nuts have a good fiber quality and are used for coir making. Nuts are also used for seeding and should be stored for 2 to 3 months after harvest in case of tall variety Coconut and that of the dwarf variety should be sown within 10 to 15 days of harvest. Each tree can have 8 harvests annually. There are three different recommended methods of harvest, i.e. climbing, power tiller operated ladder and by using climbing cycle.</p>
<p>While harvesting, the climber cuts the bunch at the base of the stalk such that it drops to the ground, but if tender nuts are being harvested or the ground is very hard, the bunches are lowered using a rope. The climber as a part of harvest cleans the crown by removing the dry leaves, sheaths, and spathes. The average yield from a Coconut tree is expected to be around 80-100 nuts a year (largely depends on the variety and growing conditions).</p>

pest and disease management 
****

<p>The pests that infest the grape vines are flea beetles, thrips, mealybugs, and leafhoppers. The common diseases found on the grape vines are powdery mildew, downy mildew, and anthracnose. These pests and diseases can be controlled by using some organic measures like the dasparni arka, cow dung, and urine, decoction of the acacia leaves etc.</p>
<p>Other than these diseases and pests causing harm to the grape vines, there are some physiological disorders that may occur in the vines such as water berries, cluster tip wilting, short berries, pink berries, bud and flower drop, poor maturing of the cane etc. The first important measure to control these problems is to avoid excessive irrigation to the farm. The mineral deficiency in the soil should be corrected and the berry bunches should be protected from direct sunlight in order to control the above disorders.</p>


****
harvesting and yield 
****

<p>The color of the grape doesn’t always indicate its maturity, so grapes are taste-tested to check their level of maturity and then clusters of grapes are cut using a sharp knife. If the grapes don’t drop off the vine, then they should be left on it to ripen else they should be picked and stored in a cool, dry and ventilated place. Grapes that are grown for making raisins are generally harvested at a late stage. The blend ratio of sugar: acid should be 25: 30.1. The best harvesting time is during March or April. The cluster of grapes should not be pulled with a jerk otherwise this may crush the berries. The picked clusters should be gently placed in boxes and immediately moved into a shaded region.</p>
<p>The production of grapes is high in peninsular India and is estimated to be around 60 tonnes per hectare for the anab-e-shahi variety in south India. The average yield obtained from a grape vineyard is around 20 to 33 tonnes per hectare in the second or third year of planting. The yield increases in the subsequent years. The life of a grapevine is 15 years and the production and harvest are expected during the entire life span.</p>
