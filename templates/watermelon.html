                <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-green-800 mt-8">When and How to Harvest Watermelons:
                </h1>
                <p class="text-xl">Generally, Watermelons are ready to be harvested when they reach full maturity, which can vary depending on the variety and growing conditions. As a rule of thumb, most Watermelons are ready to be harvested 75-80 days after planting. One way to tell if a is ready for harvest is by looking at the tendril closest to the fruit ‚Äì if it‚Äôs dried up and turned brown, your melon is likely ripe.
                Another method is by examining the spot where the melon rests on the ground ‚Äì if it changes from white to a creamy yellow color, that‚Äôs a good sign that it‚Äôs ready to be picked. And, of course, there‚Äôs always the classic thumping technique ‚Äì a ripe should sound hollow when tapped.
                Once you‚Äôve determined that your Watermelon is indeed ripe, it‚Äôs time to carefully cut it from the vine using shears or a sharp knife. To harvest your, use a sharp knife or shears to cut through the stem about an inch above where it connects to the fruit. Be gentle with handling them as they can be quite delicate.

                <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-green-800 mt-8">Expected Average Yield of Watermelon per Acre:</h1>
                <p class="text-xl">Watermelon farming is a rewarding venture with the potential for high yields per acre. The expected average yield of Watermelons can vary depending on soil quality and proper cultivation practices. On average, a well-managed farm can yield around 25,000 to 60,000 pounds of Watermelon per acre. To achieve optimal yields, it is crucial to follow recommended planting techniques to provide adequate irrigation and nutrient management throughout the growing season.
