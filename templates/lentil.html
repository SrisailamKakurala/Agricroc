                <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-green-800 mt-8">Lentil Farming Income, Cost, and Profit:</h1>
                <p class="text-xl">To cultivate lentils in one acre, approximately 12-15 kilograms of seeds are required.
                    Farmers can expect a yield of 6-8 quintals (600-800 kilograms) from one acre of lentil field.
                    The average market price for lentils ranges from â‚¹4,000 to â‚¹5,500 per quintal, depending on the quality of the produce11.
                                   
                    </p>
                
                <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-green-800 mt-8">Varieties of Lentils:</h1>
                <p class="text-xl">Lentils (Lens culinaris) are also known as Masur and Malka.
                    Major lentil-growing states in India include West Bengal, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana, Punjab, and Madhya Pradesh.
                    Lentils are rich in proteins and widely used in curry preparations across India.
                    India ranks first globally in terms of area and second in terms of lentil production11.

                <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-green-800 mt-8">Cost of Cultivation for 1 Acre of Lentil:</h1>
                <p class="text-xl">Land/Soil Preparation: Deep plowing followed by 2-3 harrowings is essential. Renting tractor-drawn implements for these operations costs around â‚¹1,700.
                    Seed Material: Quality lentil seeds cost â‚¹75 per kilogram. For 15 kilograms of seeds, the total cost is approximately â‚¹1,125.
                    Sowing: Rows are marked 8-10 inches apart, and sowing can be done with the help of 2 laborers. Labor costs vary around â‚¹400.
                    Fertilizers and Manures: Application of 4-5 tonnes of farmyard manure per acre is recommended during the last plowing.
                    Miscellaneous Activities: Other costs include weeding, plant protection measures, harvesting, drying, and threshing11.
                    
                    
                    </p>
               
                <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-green-800 mt-8">Global Scenario:</h1>
                <p class="text-xl">Lentil output in India has shown a relatively flat trend due to modest growth in yield figures.
                    In value terms, lentil production rose slightly to $1.1 billion in 2022 (estimated export price)22.
                    </p>

                <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-green-800 mt-8">Profit Potential:</h1>
                <p class="text-xl">With proper cultivation practices, lentil farmers can achieve high yields and earn good profits.
                    The demand for lentils is growing both domestically and internationally33.
                    In summary, lentil farming offers promising returns, and its nutritional value makes it a valuable crop. Happy farming! ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒŸ
