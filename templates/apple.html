                <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold">Letâ€™s delve into the fascinating world of Apple cultivation in India. ðŸŒ¾</h1>
                
                <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-green-800 mt-8">Climate required for Apple farming:

                </h1>
                <p class="text-xl">Apple can be grown at altitudes 1,500 m to 2,700 m. above sea level, in the Himalayan range which experience 1,000 to 1,500 hours of chilling or cooling (the number of hours during which temperatures remains at or below 70 C in winter season). The temperature during the apple growing season should be around 21 C to 24 C. For best growth and fruiting, apple trees need 100 cm to125 cm of annual rainfall, evenly spread throughout the year. Too much of rainfall and fog near the fruit maturity period would result in poor fruit quality with improper color development of fruit and fungal spots on the fruit surface. Apple cultivation is not suitable where the high velocity of winds are expected.</p>
                
                <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-green-800 mt-8">Soil requirement for Apple farming:</h1>
                <p class="text-xl">Apple cultivation is suitable in loamy soils with rich in organic matter and pH range of 5.5 â€“ 6.5. Soil should not have water logging and soil with good drainage is ideal for apple farming.
                    </p>

                <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-green-800 mt-8">Irrigation/Water supply in Apple farming:</h1>
                <p class="text-xl">The irrigation requirement in Apple farming is 115 cm/annum which should be scheduled in 14 to 20 watering/irrigations. In summer, watering should be provided at an interval of 6 to 10 days while in winter it is given at an interval of 3 to 4 weeks. At least 8 irrigations are required during the critical period April to August after fruit set.</p>
               
                <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-green-800 mt-8">Pests and Diseases in Apple farming:</h1>
                <p class="text-xl">The main pests in apple plantation are wooly apple aphid (Eriosoma lanigerum), san Jose scale (Quadraspidiotus perniciosus), blossom thrips (Thrips rhopalantennalis), white scale (Pseudoulacaspis sp.), etc. Suitable intercultural operations Planting of resistant rootstocks, and spraying with fenitrothion,chloropyriphos, carbaryl, etc. have been found to be more effective in controlling the pests in apple plantation.The main diseases found in apple farming are apple scab (Venturia inaequalis), collar rot (Phytophthora cactorum), crown gall (Agrobacterium tumefaciens),sclerotius blight (Sclerotium rolfsii), cankers, die-back diseases, etc. Apple plants that are resistant to the diseases should be used for cultivation. The infected plant parts should be destroyed. Apply carbendazim, copper oxychloride, mancozeb and other <a href="#" class="google-anno" style="border: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important; display: inline !important; float: none !important; margin: 0px !important; outline: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important; text-decoration: none !important; fill: currentcolor !important;"><svg viewBox="100 -1000 840 840" width="calc(16px - 2px)" height="16px" style="border: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important; display: inline !important; float: none !important; margin: 0px !important; outline: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important;"><path d="m784-120-252-252q-30 24-69 38t-83 14q-109 0-184.5-75.5t-75.5-184.5q0-109 75.5-184.5t184.5-75.5q109 0 184.5 75.5t75.5 184.5q0 44-14 83t-38 69l252 252-56 56zm-404-280q75 0 127.5-52.5t52.5-127.5q0-75-52.5-127.5t-127.5-52.5q-75 0-127.5 52.5t-52.5 127.5q0 75 52.5 127.5t127.5 52.5z"></path></svg>&nbsp;<span class="google-anno-t" style="border: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important; display: inline !important; float: none !important; margin: 0px !important; outline: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important; text-decoration: underline dotted !important;">fungicides</span></a> for controlling the diseases.

                <p class="text-xl">The average yield of different apple varieties in Jammu &amp; Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh which is around 11 to 13 tonnes /hectare. In Uttaranchal state, the yield is reported as very low 5 to 6 tonnes/hectare
