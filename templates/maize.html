                <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold">Maize (corn) cultivation is an essential field crop in India. Letâ€™s explore its cultivation, cost, profit, demand, and yield:</h1>
                
                <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-green-800 mt-8">Cultivation Income and Yield:</h1>
                <p class="text-xl">Maize is the third most important cereal after rice and wheat, contributing nearly 9% to Indiaâ€™s national food basket.
                    It serves as staple food for humans and quality feed for poultry and animals.
                    Maize is also a raw material for various industries, including textiles, pharmaceuticals, corn oil, sweeteners, cosmetics, and alcoholic beverages.
                    The average production of maize is estimated to be around 2.5 metric tonnes per hectare annually.
                    India exports around 7 lakh metric tonnes of maize to other countries, earning an income of more than one thousand crores1[3]21.
                    </p>
                
                <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-green-800 mt-8">Soil and Climate:</h1>
                <p class="text-xl">Maize grows well in temperatures between 22Â°C to 30Â°C, tolerating up to 35Â°C.
                    It requires at least 50 to 90 cm of rainfall annually.
                    Soils rich in organic matter, with good drainage, are suitable for maize cultivation.
                    Clay loam, sandy loam, and black cotton soils are ideal.
                    States like Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Orissa, and Punjab are major maize producers in India. </p>

                <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-green-800 mt-8">Popular Varieties:</h1>

                <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-green-800 mt-8">Cost of Cultivation for 1 Acre:</h1>
                <p class="text-xl">Seed material: Around 8 kilograms of seeds are required.
                    Land preparation, sowing, weeding, fertilizers, pesticides, and harvesting contribute to the total cost.
                    The average market price for one quintal of maize is Rs. 1200.
                    Net profit from 1-acre maize farming can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from total returns32.
                    
                    In summary, maize cultivation offers both nutritional benefits and economic viability. Happy farming! ðŸŒ½ðŸŒŸ
