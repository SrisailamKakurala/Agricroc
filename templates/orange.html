The leaves ultimately start yellowing and curling up which makes the plant less productive. Pruning the infested leaves is a good solution to the problem.these pests also cause leaf deformation and stunted growth in twigs and can be controlled by spraying pesticides.The common diseases of orange plants are leaf rot, fruit rot, scab, stem rot, Phytophthora and Penicillium.

                <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-green-800 mt-8">harvesting and yield:</h1>
                <p class="text-xl">Generally, orange plants produce three flushes termed as ambia bahar during Dec â€“Jan, mrig bahar during June- July and hastha bahar during Sept-Oct. The harvest of orange plants is done only after 3 or 4 years from planting and it is estimated that a single tree can produce 40-50 fruits. The productive life span of an orange tree is around 15 to 20 years. The full bearing capacity of the tree is attained only after 10 years. The size and color of the fruit are the main factors which indicate harvesting time. Normally it is believed that the fruits mature in 240-280 days. Harvesting is done using clippers or shears.
