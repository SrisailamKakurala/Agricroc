                <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-green-800 mt-8">Significance of Chickpea:</h1>
                <p class="text-xl">Chickpea is a major pulse crop, constituting about 49% of the total pulses produced in India.
                    It is grown across various agro-climatic zones in almost every part of the country.
                    Chickpeas are rich in protein, fiber, complex carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals, making them a nutritious food choice.
                    They are known for their efficient utilization of soil moisture and nutrients, as well as their positive impact on soil properties.

                <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-green-800 mt-8">Varieties and Research:</h1>
                <p class="text-xl">More than 250 chickpea varieties have been developed in India to date.
                    These varieties exhibit higher yield potential, reduced crop duration, large-seeded kabuli types, and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses.
                    Research efforts have led to improved chickpea varieties suitable for different regions.
                    </p>

                <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-green-800 mt-8">Profit Potential:</h1>
                <p class="text-xl">On average, a farmer can obtain around 8 quintals of chickpea crop per acre.
                    Selling at the market rate (e.g., Rs. 3,325 per quintal), the total income from 1 acre of chickpea cultivation can be approximately Rs. 26,6001.                    
                    </p>
               
                <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-green-800 mt-8">Market Trends:</h1>
                <p class="text-xl">Chickpeas are widely consumed, and the demand is met through both domestic production and imports.
                    Canned chickpeas are imported from countries like the USA, Italy, and Malaysia.
                    In summary, chickpea cultivation offers both nutritional benefits and economic viability. Happy farming! ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒŸ
